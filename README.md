 # ðŸŽ“ # OOPS_Lab_Work

This repository contains lab assignments and practical exercises focused on Object-Oriented Programming Systems (OOPS). While a few initial programs were written in C, the repository now exclusively features C++ code for all new additions.

## Repository Overview

- **Language:** C++ (with a few legacy C programs)
- **Purpose:** To provide a comprehensive collection of lab exercises and sample programs for learning and practicing OOPS concepts.
- **Contents:** Source code demonstrating OOPS fundamentals such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and other core principles, all implemented in C++.

## Usage

Browse the source files to study C++ OOPS examples or use them as reference material for your own assignments and learning.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MRuhullah/OOPS_Lab_Work.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd OOPS_Lab_Work
   ```
3. Compile and run the C++ programs using your preferred compiler.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add more OOPS lab exercises or improve existing ones, feel free to open a pull request.
